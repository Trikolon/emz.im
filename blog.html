        <span slot="title">From Cloud to Cloud</span>
        <div slot="body">
          <p>Over the years, I've used many different personal cloud services.
          Back in school, around 2013, Dropbox was quite popular, so everybody
          used that. No fancy web interface or live editing docs, just a solid
          sync client.</p>

          <p>I had even written a small chat client in Java that used a shared
          file in my Dropbox as a communication channel. Apart from the
          occasional synchronization conflict, it worked surprisingly well. At
          the time, I didn't think deeply about privacy or security—it simply
          worked, and that was good enough until around 2014-2015. Edward
          Snowden warned against using Dropbox <a
          href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/jul/17/edward-snowden-dropbox-privacy-spideroak">in
          an interview with The Guardian</a> as early as 2014, recommending
          "zero knowledge" services instead. Since then I've always wanted a
          solution with end-to-end encryption.</p>

          <p>Later, I moved most of my files to Google Drive due to convenience.
          Already having email integrated there made the transition seamless,
          and the Google Docs integration was excellent for collaboration. This
          was also the point when my files exceeded typical free storage tiers
          (~15GB), prompting my first paid cloud storage subscription. Google
          Drive offered 1TB for around 10€ per month back then, that seemed
          fair. Privacy-wise, however, this wasn't a big improvement over
          Dropbox—both Google Drive and Google Photos lack end-to-end
          encryption.</p>
          
          <p>In 2015, driven primarily by privacy concerns, I chose a
          self-hosted solution: ownCloud. At that time, its now-popular fork,
          NextCloud, didn't yet exist. Renting a dedicated server from Hetzner
          for approximately 30€ per month, I installed ownCloud and set up a
          software RAID 1 configuration using two 2TB HDDs. This gave me about
          2TB of usable space. Things initially ran smoothly, allowing me to
          migrate all my files from Google Drive. Over time, friends and family
          even started using my server.</p>

          <p>However, maintaining my own cloud came with challenges. The sync
          client wasn't very mature back then, and I ran into frequent
          synchronization issues, particularly when working with lots of files.
          My friends and family experienced similar issues. Administration,
          especially major version upgrades, wasn't trivial back then. Today's
          NextCloud docker deployment options look more straightforward, so I
          would like to revisit this solution.</p>
          
          <p>Another significant problem was backups. If I wanted to keep
          running this, especially with friends' data, I'd need a proper backup
          solution, meaning additional costs for backup storage. Financially and
          administratively, the project became unsustainable, so I wound it down
          over the next few months.</p>
          
          <p>I decided to migrate my data back to Google Drive and stayed there
          for a couple years, until I entered back into the Apple ecosystem. I
          got a MacBook for work and eventually switched back from Android to
          iOS. The tight integration with macOS and iOS is what made me want to
          try iCloud. When Apple eventually <a
          href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2022/12/apple-advances-user-security-with-powerful-new-data-protections/">announced
          Advanced Data Protection</a>, a mode in which they claim to end-to-end
          encrypt most of the sensitive photos, notes and file data, I made the
          switch. It was the first big cloud service that offered E2E encryption.
          Transferring the data was painful. With Advanced Data Protection
          enabled, only Apple devices can read/write data. Since I had more data
          in Google Drive than disk size I had to stagger the uploads. Upload
          some of the data, delete parts of the local files, then upload more.
          This was a tedious process that took a couple days, not only because
          of my slow upload speed back then.</p>

          <h2>Popular (Private?) Cloud Services</h2>

          <p>Over the years I've always looked around for better cloud storage
          solutions. The mainstream products often have the best features
          (Google Drive) or better integration with the ecosystem (Apple
          iCloud). What they lack is verifiable end-to-end encryption. Google
          Drive doesn't offer it at all, and Apple's "Advanced Data Protection"
          claims it encrypts at least the file contents, but since it's not open
          source this claim can not be verified.</p>

          <p>I want to explore more privacy-oriented products, such as Proton
          Drive, but looking at recent reviews, they haven't yet achieved the
          maturity level and feature set I'd expect.</p>

          <p>For photos, <a href="https://ente.io">Ente</a> seems
          promising—open-source, end-to-end encrypted, and comparable in price.
          It even offers <a
          href="https://help.ente.io/self-hosting/">self-hosting</a>.
          </p>

          <p>
            For files NextCloud seems like the most mature solution nowadays. It
            can be self hosted, e.g. <a
            href="https://github.com/nextcloud/all-in-one">via Docker</a>, or
            you can rent a managed instance with a provider such as <a
            href="https://www.ionos.de/office-loesungen/managed-nextcloud-hosting">IONOS</a> and
            <a
            href="https://www.hetzner.com/storage/storage-share/">Hetzner</a>.
            For more privacy I'd go with the self-hosted solution here, since
            the companies managing these instances, at least theoretically, have
            access to your data. Nextcloud's end-to-end encryption App/Module
            only covers specific folders. Even if it covered all cloud data,
            nothing would stop these hosts from changing the server
            implementation to provide a backdoor into the data.
          </p>

          <h2>Going Back to Self-Hosting</h2>
          
          <p>Currently, I'm planning a return to self-hosting. I intend to
          purchase a small workstation to run Nextcloud, Jellyfin or Plex,
          Immich, and Home Assistant via Docker. I'll share more details as the
          project progresses.</p>

          <h2>Addendum</h2>
          
          <p>Here are cloud services I find interesting but haven't yet tried:</p>
          <ul>
              <li><a href="https://proton.me/drive">Proton Drive</a>: Cloud
              storage with E2E encryption.</li>
              <li><a href="https://immich.app">Immich</a>: Self-hosted photo and
              video storage, an open-source alternative.</li>
              <li><a href="https://ente.io">Ente / Ente self-hosted</a>:
              Privacy-centric photo storage with E2E encryption.</li>
          </ul>
