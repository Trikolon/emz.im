      <span slot="title">Google is Scrapping Plans for Third-Party Cookie Deprecation</span>
      <div slot="body">
        <p>After years of pushing timelines for third-party cookie
          deprecation and eventually watering it down to an opt-in dialog, it
          seems Google has now fully given up on it:</p>

        <p><a
            href="https://privacysandbox.com/news/privacy-sandbox-next-steps/#:~:text=we’ve%20made%20the,and%20Security%20Settings.">Next
            steps for Privacy Sandbox and tracking protections in Chrome</a></p>

        <blockquote>
          we’ve made the decision to maintain our current approach to
          offering users third-party cookie choice in Chrome, and will not
          be rolling out a new standalone prompt for third-party cookies.
        </blockquote>

        <p>This is such a huge loss for Chrome users and the web as a
          whole.</p>

        <p>They still block third-party cookies in incognito mode, but
          that’s such a small share of browsing.</p>

        <p>They also say:</p>

        <blockquote>
          Users can continue to choose the best option for themselves in
          Chrome’s Privacy and Security Settings.
        </blockquote>

        <p>That’s nice, but only a small share of users goes into these
          settings, let alone understands the privacy implications of
          disabling third-party cookies.</p>

        <p>There will also be not a lot of incentive for users to turn
          third-party cookies off, as websites which rely on them will
          continue to break. With third-party cookies enabled for the majority
          of users on the web, website vendors have no incentive to build
          alternatives and ad-networks still have free reign to track
          users.</p>
